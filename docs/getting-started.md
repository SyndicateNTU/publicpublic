# Welcome to **Syndicate**

Syndicate is a community exclusively for **Computer Engineering (CE)** students at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**. We aim to foster collaboration, innovation, and learning by connecting like-minded individuals. Before joining, weâ€™d like to understand you better and gauge your technical skills to help us create an ideal experience for you.

## Step 1: Personality Assessment  
We want to tailor this community experience to suit you. Please take the following personality assessment to understand:  
1. Your **ideal working environment** (e.g., collaborative, independent, etc.).  
2. Your **learning style** (e.g., visual, auditory, hands-on).  

### How to take the test  
Use one of the following free platforms to complete a personality test:  
- [16Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test)  
- [SkillsYouNeed Learning Style Quiz](https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ls/index.php/ls/test)  

After completing the test, save the result report as a **PDF** and upload it through the form below:

## Step 2: Technical Questions  
Showcase your technical skills by solving the following questions. This is to assess your coding, hardware, and protocol knowledge.
#### Please keep in mind you don't need to solve all the above questions - only the ones you can. For the rest, please include a text indicating your thinking.

Everyone is welcome to Syndicate. This form is only to help us provide better suited projects & activities for all of our fellow mates.

### Instructions  
- You can choose to solve the coding questions in **C**, **Python**, or **Java**.  
- For the Arduino question, ensure you include a detailed explanation of the logic and implementation.  
- All answers should be submitted as a ZIP file containing your code and documentation through the form below.

### Questions  

#### Coding (Choose your preferred language: C, Python, or Java)  
1. **Algorithm Optimization**  
   Write a function to calculate the **longest increasing subsequence** of a given array. Ensure that your implementation is optimized for O(n log n) complexity.  
   
   Eg: Input: [10, 22, 9, 33, 21, 50, 41, 60]
   Output: 5
   (Explanation: The LIS is [10, 22, 33, 50, 60])

2. **Data Structures**  
Implement a **min-heap** from scratch. The heap should support the following operations efficiently:  
- `insert(element)`  
- `extract_min()`  
- `delete(element)`  

#### Arduino  
3. **Hardware Logic**  
Design an Arduino program that takes input from an **ultrasonic sensor** and triggers a **buzzer** when an object is detected within 20 cm. Include the following:  
- Explanation of connections (sensor pins, buzzer, etc.).  
- A well-commented Arduino code snippet.  
- Optimization to ensure minimal delay in sensor response.  

#### Communication Protocols  
4. **I2C Communication**  
Explain the I2C protocol in detail and write a code snippet for a **master Arduino** device to send data to a slave device.  
Include:  
- Start/stop conditions.  
- Data acknowledgment mechanism.  
- Code to send a byte of data from the master to the slave.
