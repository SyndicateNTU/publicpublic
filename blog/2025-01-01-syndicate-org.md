Greetings Tinkerers! ðŸ”¥

After too many discussions and rageful arguments, we are finally an actual community for CE Students who are in NTU (sorry we aren't well funded (or even funded) to accomodate students outside of NTU yet). But, as of Jan 1 2025, **we are now officially a [Syndicate](https://github.com/spicetify) on GitHub! ðŸŽ‰**

Essentially, Syndicate was created to enable more student led projects which don't seem to be very accessible normally. This community has been created with intentions to help every student (irrespective of his GPA) contribute to open-source projects and even upskill from our workshops.

> We hope to be a great source of knowledge and hands-on work experience for everyone, and we are looking forward to enhancing it with new features and improvements. ðŸ™Œ
